## Sales Engine

This project was done using Ruby as part of Module 1 for the Turing School of Software and Design with David Stinnette. The purpose of this project was to create a data reporting tool that manipulates and reports on merchant transactional data, somewhat similar to ActiveRecord.

###Project Goals

* Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
* Build a complex system of relationships using multiple interacting classes
* Demonstrate the DRY principle with modules and/or duck typing
* Separate parsing and data loading logic from business logic
* Use memoization to improve performance

The challenge of this project was understanding how the different components of the structure fit together, figuring out out how to access the different attributes associated with the different branches of the system in a clear and concise way.
